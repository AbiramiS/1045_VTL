6. About (Short Description / Summary):

	The mainstay of this project is to describe a system based on virtual trip lines and an associated cloaking technique, in which we relax the privacy requirements to maximize the accuracy of real-time traffic estimation. Traffic monitoring using probe vehicles with GPS receivers promises significant improvements in cost, coverage, and accuracy over dedicated infrastructure systems. Current approaches, however, raise privacy concerns because they require participants to reveal their positions to an external traffic monitoring server.
